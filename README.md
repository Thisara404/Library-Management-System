- üîê Secure Login System
  - Separate access levels for Admin and Members
  - Role-based authentication and privileges
- üìö Comprehensive Book Management
  - Add, update, delete, and search books
  - Multiple search methods (by title, by title and author)
  - Detailed book information tracking
- üë• Member Management
  - Full member lifecycle management
  - Membership card tracking
  - Admin-controlled member operations

## Technical Specifications
### Architecture
- **Design Pattern:** Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Layers:**
  - Model Layer: Data and business logic
  - View Layer: User interface components
  - Controller Layer: Interaction management

### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
1. **Encapsulation**
   - Private fields with public getters and setters
   - Data protection in Book, Member, and MembershipCard classes
2. **Inheritance**
   - User class as a base for Admin and Member classes
   - Code reusability and hierarchical design
3. **Polymorphism**
   - Method overriding (e.g., `displayDetails()`)
   - Flexible method implementations
4. **Abstraction**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Interfaces and abstract classes for common behaviors
5. **Aggregation & Composition**
   - Loose coupling between Books and Members
   - Strong relationship with MembershipCard

### Exception Handling
- Robust error management for:
  - Invalid login attempts
  - Empty form submissions
  - Unauthorized access scenarios
