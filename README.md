# Library Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is a robust Java-based application designed to streamline library operations through an intuitive graphical user interface. Developed as part of the Advanced Technological Institute Kandy's Information Technology program, this project demonstrates advanced software engineering principles and object-oriented programming techniques.

## Key Features

- üîê Secure Login System
  - Separate access levels for Admin and Members
  - Role-based authentication and privileges

- üìö Comprehensive Book Management
  - Add, update, delete, and search books
  - Multiple search methods (by title, by title and author)
  - Detailed book information tracking

- üë• Member Management
  - Full member lifecycle management
  - Membership card tracking
  - Admin-controlled member operations

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- **Design Pattern:** Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Layers:**
  - Model Layer: Data and business logic
  - View Layer: User interface components
  - Controller Layer: Interaction management

### Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Private fields with public getters and setters
   - Data protection in Book, Member, and MembershipCard classes

2. **Inheritance**
   - User class as a base for Admin and Member classes
   - Code reusability and hierarchical design

3. **Polymorphism**
   - Method overriding (e.g., `displayDetails()`)
   - Flexible method implementations

4. **Abstraction**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Interfaces and abstract classes for common behaviors

5. **Aggregation & Composition**
   - Loose coupling between Books and Members
   - Strong relationship with MembershipCard

### Exception Handling
- Robust error management for:
  - Invalid login attempts
  - Empty form submissions
  - Unauthorized access scenarios
